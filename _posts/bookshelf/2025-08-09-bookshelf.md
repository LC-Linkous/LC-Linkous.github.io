<h3> From the Shelf: </h3>
<ul>
    <li>J. Picolet, Operator Handbook: search.copy.paste.L33T;) : Red Team + OSINT + Blue Team. Herndon, Va: Netmux, 2020. 
              (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operator-Handbook-Team-OSINT-Reference/dp/B085RR67H5" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/Operator-Handbook-Team-OSINT-Reference/dp/B085RR67H5</a>)</li>
              
</ul>

<p>
The <i> Operator Handbook </i> is designed in a similar way to the field guides featured in a previous post  (<a href="https://lc-linkous.github.io/bookshelf/2025/08/07/bookshelf.html" target="_blank">Bookshelf: Red Team Field Manual, Linux Field Manual, Purple Team Manual</a>)</li>, but it has a little more generality to it. Listed right in the table of contents are sections for AWS, Azure, Docker, Linuz, Mac OS, Windows , and more. The pages are primarily filled with tables where the left column is the command, and the right column is the description. However, there are sections where specific types of logs, actions, or standardizations are described in functional detail. 
</p>
<p>
A major point for this book in particular is that almost every page is covered in links to references. This book is not a field guide, and it’s not pretending to be one. Instead, it’s a list of (potentially) thousands of tools and resources for Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). Some of these are for particular websites or GitHub repositories, or they may be official tools. This makes it an interesting sort of reference; information dense, with a little bit of everything for all operating systems, and hovering a little out of reach of beginners but not self-contained enough to be a singular source.  Overall, it’s a useful book, and you’ll find something new every time you flip through it.
